# Storing operations logs for point-in-time recovery

Point-in-time recovery functionality allows users to roll back the cluster to a
specific date and time. Technically, this feature involves saving operations log
updates [to the cloud storage](backups-storage.md).

Starting from the Operator version 1.15.0, point-in-time recovery functionality
can be used with both logical and physical backups. Previous versions
supported point-in-time recovery only with logical backups.

To be used, it requires setting the [backup.pitr.enabled](operator.md#backuppitrenabled)
key in the `deploy/cr.yaml` configuration file:

```yaml
backup:
  ...
  pitr:
    enabled: true
    oplogOnly: true
```

Setting `backup.pitr.oplogOnly` option to `true` is needed only for physical
backups. For logical backups this option can be omitted (or set to `false`,
which is the default value).

It is necessary to have at least one full backup to use point-in-time recovery.
By default Percona Backup for MongoDB will not upload operations logs if there
is no full backup (`backup.pitr.oplogOnly` option controls this behavior).
The rule of having at least one full backup is true for new clusters and also
true for clusters which have been just recovered from backup.

!!! note

    There is also the 'backup.pitr.oplogSpanMin` option which sets the time
    period between the uploads of oplogs, with default value of 10 minutes.

Percona Backup for MongoDB uploads operations logs to the same bucket/container,
where full backup is stored. This makes point-in-time recovery functionality
available only if there is a single bucket/container in [spec.backup.storages](operator.md#backupstoragesstorage-nametype).
Otherwise point-in-time recovery will not be enabled and there will be an error
message in the operator logs.

!!! note

    Adding a new bucket or container when point-in-time recovery is enabled will
    not break it, but put error message about the additional bucket in the
    Operator logs as well.
