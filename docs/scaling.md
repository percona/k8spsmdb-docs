# Scale Percona Server for MongoDB on Kubernetes and OpenShift

One of the great advantages brought by Kubernetes and the OpenShift platform is
the ease of an application scaling. Scaling a Deployment up or down ensures new
Pods are created and set to available Kubernetes nodes.

Scaling can be vertical and horizontal. Vertical scaling adds more compute or
storage resources to MongoDB nodes; horizontal scaling is about adding more
nodes to the cluster. [High availability](architecture.md#high-availability)
looks technically similar, because it also involves additional nodes, but the
reason is maintaining liveness of the system in case of server or network
failures.

## Vertical scaling

### Scale compute

There are multiple components that Operator deploys and manages: MongoDB replica
set instances, mongos and config server instances, etc. To add or reduce CPU or
Memory you need to edit corresponding sections in the Custom Resource. We follow
the structure for requests and limits that Kubernetes [provides  :octicons-link-external-16:](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/).

To add more resources to your MongoDB replica set instances, edit the following
section in the Custom Resource:

```yaml
spec:
  replsets:
    resources:
      requests: 
        memory: 4G
        cpu: 2
      limits:
        memory: 4G
        cpu: 2
```

Use our reference documentation for the [Custom Resource options](operator.md) 
for more details about other components.

### Scale storage

Kubernetes manages storage with a PersistentVolume (PV), a segment of
storage supplied by the administrator, and a PersistentVolumeClaim
(PVC), a request for storage from a user. In Kubernetes v1.11 the
feature was added to allow a user to increase the size of an existing
PVC object (considered stable since Kubernetes v1.24).
The user cannot shrink the size of an existing PVC object.

Starting from the version 1.16.0, the Operator allows to scale Percona Server
for MongoDB storage automatically by changing the appropriate Custom Resource
option, if the volume type supports PVCs expansion.

#### Storage resizing with Volume Expansion capability

Certain volume types support PVCs expansion (exact details about
PVCs and the supported volume types can be found in [Kubernetes
documentation  :octicons-link-external-16:](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#expanding-persistent-volumes-claims)).

You can run the following command to check if your storage supports the expansion capability:

``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
$ kubectl describe sc <storage class name> | grep AllowVolumeExpansion
```

??? example "Expected output"

    ``` {.text .no-copy}
    AllowVolumeExpansion: true
    ```

To enable storage resizing via volume expansion, do the following:
{.power-number}

1. Set the [enableVolumeExpansion](operator.md#enablevolumeexpansion) Custom Resource option to `true` (it is turned off by default).
2. Specify new storage size for the  `replsets.<NAME>.volumeSpec.persistentVolumeClaim.resources.requests.storage`
and/or `configsvrReplSet.volumeSpec.persistentVolumeClaim.resources.requests.storage`
options in the Custom Resource. 

    This is the example configuration of defining a new storage size in the `deploy/cr.yaml` file:

    ``` {.text .no-copy}
    spec:
      ...
      enableVolumeExpansion: true
      ...
      replsets:
        ...
        volumeSpec:
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: <NEW STORAGE SIZE>
      ...
      configsvrReplSets:
        volumeSpec:
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: <NEW STORAGE SIZE>
    ```

3. Apply changes as usual:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl apply -f cr.yaml
    ```

After you apply the configuration, the Operator will automatically expand the storage for you.


#### Manual resizing without Volume Expansion capability

Manual resizing is the way to go if your version of the Operator is older than
1.16.0 or your volumes are of the type which does not support Volume Expansion.

You will need to delete Pods one by one and their persistent volumes to resync 
the data to the new volumes. **This can also be used to shrink the storage.**

1. Update the Custom Resource with the new storage size by editing and applying
    the `deploy/cr.yaml` file:

    ``` {.text .no-copy}
    spec:
      ...
      replsets:
        ...
        volumeSpec:
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: <NEW STORAGE SIZE>
    ```

    Apply the Custom Resource update in a usual way:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl apply -f deploy/cr.yaml
    ```

2. Delete the StatefulSet with the `orphan` option

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl delete sts <statefulset-name> --cascade=orphan
    ```

    The Pods will not go down and the Operator is going to recreate
    the StatefulSet:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl get sts <statefulset-name>
    ```

    ??? example "Expected output"

        ``` {.text .no-copy}
        my-cluster-name-rs0       3/3     39s
        ```

3. Scale up the cluster (Optional)

    Changing the storage size would require us to terminate the Pods, which 
    decreases the computational power of the cluster and might cause performance 
    issues. To improve performance during the operation we are going to 
    change the size of the cluster from 3 to 5 nodes:

    ```yaml
    spec:
      ...
      replsets:
        ...
        size: 5
    ```
    
    Apply the change:
    
    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl apply -f deploy/cr.yaml
    ```

    New Pods will already have new storage:
    
    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl get pvc
    ```

    ??? example "Expected output"

        ``` {.text .no-copy}
        NAME                                STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
        mongod-data-my-cluster-name-cfg-0   Bound    pvc-a2b37f4d-6f11-443c-8670-de82ce9fc335   10Gi       RWO            standard       110m
        mongod-data-my-cluster-name-cfg-1   Bound    pvc-ded949e5-0f93-4f57-ab2c-7c5fd9528fa0   10Gi       RWO            standard       109m
        mongod-data-my-cluster-name-cfg-2   Bound    pvc-f3a441dd-94b6-4dc0-b96c-58b7851dfaa0   10Gi       RWO            standard       108m
        mongod-data-my-cluster-name-rs0-0   Bound    pvc-b183c40b-c165-445a-aacd-9a34b8fff227   19Gi       RWO            standard       49m
        mongod-data-my-cluster-name-rs0-1   Bound    pvc-f186426b-cbbe-4c31-860e-97a4dfca3de0   19Gi       RWO            standard       47m
        mongod-data-my-cluster-name-rs0-2   Bound    pvc-6beb6ccd-8b3a-4580-b3ef-a2345a2c21d6   19Gi       RWO            standard       45m 
        ```

4. Delete PVCs and Pods with old storage size one by one. Wait for data to sync 
    before you proceeding to the next node.

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl delete pvc <PVC NAME>
    $ kubectl delete pod <POD NAME>
    ```
    The new PVC is going to be created along with the Pod.

## Horizontal scaling

### Replica Sets

You can change the size separately for different components of your MongoDB replica set by setting these options in the appropriate subsections:

* [replsets.size](operator.md#replsetssize) allows you to set the size of the MongoDB Replica Set,
* [replsets.nonvoting.size](operator.md#replsetsnonvotingsize) allows you to set the number of non-voting members,
* [replsets.arbiter.size](operator.md#replsetsarbitersize) allows you to set the number of [Replica Set Arbiter instances](arbiter.md),

For example, the following update in `deploy/cr.yaml` sets the size of the MongoDB Replica Set `rs0` to `5` nodes:

```yaml
spec:
  ...
  replsets:
  - name: rs0
    size: 5
    ...
```

Donâ€™t forget to apply changes as usual, running the `kubectl apply -f deploy/cr.yaml` command.

!!! note

    The Operator will not allow to scale Percona Server for MongoDB with the `kubectl scale statefulset <StatefulSet name>` command as it puts `size` configuration options out of sync.

### Sharding

You can change the size for different components of your MongoDB sharded cluster by setting these options in the appropriate subsections:

* [sharding.configsvrReplSet.size](operator.md#shardingconfigsvrreplsetsize) allows to set the number of [Config Server instances  :octicons-link-external-16:](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/sharded-cluster-config-servers/) in a sharded cluster,
* [sharding.mongos.size](operator.md#shardingmongossize) allows to set the number of [mongos  :octicons-link-external-16:](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/sharded-cluster-query-router/) instances in a sharded cluster.

#### Changing the number of shards

You can change the number of shards of an existing cluster by adding or removing members in the [spec.replsets](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-mongodb/operator.html#replsets-section) subsection.

For example, given the following cluster that has 2 shards:

```yaml
spec:
  ...
  replsets:
  - name: rs0
    size: 3
    ...
  - name: rs1
    size: 3
    ...
```

You can add an extra shard by applying the following configuration:

```yaml
spec:
  ...
  replsets:
  - name: rs0
    size: 3
    ...
  - name: rs1
    size: 3
    ...
  - name: rs2
    size: 3
    ...
```

Similary, you can reduce the number of shards by removing the `rs1` and `rs2` elements:

```yaml
spec:
  ...
  replsets:
  - name: rs0
    size: 3
    ...
```

!!! note

    The Operator will not allow you to remove existing shards unless they don't have any user-created collections. It is your responsibility to ensure the shard's data is [migrated to the remaining shards](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/remove-shards-from-cluster) in the cluster before trying to applying this change.
