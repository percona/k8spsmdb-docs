## Bugs Fixed

* {{ k8spsmdbjira(1117) }}: Fix a bug where the Operator incorrectly compares `G` with `Gi` and and tries to downscale PVC size after upgrade

## Supported Platforms

The Operator was developed and tested with Percona Server for MongoDB 5.0.26-22,
6.0.15-12, and 7.0.8-5. Other options may also work but have not been tested. The
Operator also uses Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.4.1.

The following platforms were tested and are officially supported by the Operator
1.16.2:

* [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) :octicons-link-external-16:](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) 1.26-1.29
* [Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS) :octicons-link-external-16:](https://aws.amazon.com) 1.26-1.29
