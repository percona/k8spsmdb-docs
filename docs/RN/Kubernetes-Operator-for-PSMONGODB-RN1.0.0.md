The Percona Kubernetes Operator for Percona Server for MongoDB automates the lifecycle of your Percona Server for MongoDB environment. The Operator can be used to create a Percona Server for MongoDB replica set, or scale an existing replica set.

The Operator creates a Percona Server for MongoDB replica set with the needed settings and provides a consistent Percona Server for MongoDB instance. The Percona Kubernetes Operators are based on best practices for configuration and setup of the Percona Server for MongoDB.

The Kubernetes Operators provide a consistent way to package, deploy, manage, and perform a backup and a restore for a Kubernetes application. Operators deliver automation advantages in cloud-native applications and may save time while providing a consistent environment.

The advantages are the following:
    
* Deploy a Percona Server for MongoDB environment with no single point of failure and environment can span multiple availability zones (AZs).

* Deployment takes about six minutes with the default configuration.

* Modify the Percona Server for MongoDB size parameter to add or remove Percona Server for MongoDB replica set members

* Integrate with Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) to seamlessly monitor your Percona Server for MongoDB

* Automate backups or perform on-demand backups as needed with support for performing an automatic restore

* Supports using Cloud storage with S3-compatible APIs for backups

* Automate the recovery from failure of a Percona Server for MongoDB replica set member

* TLS is enabled by default for replication and client traffic using Cert-Manager

* Access private registries to enhance security

* Supports advanced Kubernetes features such as pod disruption budgets, node selector, constraints, tolerations, priority classes, and affinity/anti-affinity

* You can use either PersistentVolumeClaims or local storage with hostPath to store your database

* Supports a replica set Arbiter member

* Supports Percona Server for MongoDB versions 3.6 and 4.0
