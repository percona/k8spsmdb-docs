# Install Percona Server for MongoDB cluster using Everest

[Percona Everest :octicons-link-external-16:  :octicons-link-external-16:](https://docs.percona.com/everest/) is an open source cloud-native database platform that helps developers deploy code faster, scale deployments rapidly, and reduce database administration overhead while regaining control over their data, database configuration, and DBaaS costs.

It automates day-one and day-two database operations for open source databases on Kubernetes clusters.
Percona Everest provides API and Web GUI to launch databases with just a few clicks and scale them, do routine maintenance tasks, such as software updates, patch management, backups, and monitoring.
