# Percona Operator for MongoDB

The Percona Operator for MongoDB runs and manages Percona Server for MongoDB inside Kubernetes for you. You describe the database you want (for example how many nodes, where to store backups), and the Operator keeps the cluster running that way: it creates the right pods, handles failures, and applies upgrades when you ask for them.

**Why use it?** You get a production-ready MongoDB cluster on Kubernetes without wiring every detail yourself. The Operator handles provisioning, scaling, backups, and high availability so you can focus on building your application or operating the platform.
