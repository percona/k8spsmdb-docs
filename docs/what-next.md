# What's next?

Congratulations! You have completed the steps in your Get started path.

## If you're building an application

* [Connect your application](connect-from-app.md) — Use the connection URI in your app with any MongoDB driver
* [Get credentials for your app](app-credentials.md) — Create a dedicated application user and use it in your connection string
* [Connect from your laptop or CI](connect-from-outside.md) — Use port-forward for local dev or expose the cluster for shared access
* [Connection examples (Node, Python, Go)](connection-examples.md) — Minimal code snippets to get started
* [App configuration](app-configuration.md) — Use environment variables, a dedicated app user, and optional retries
* [Troubleshoot connection issues](troubleshoot-connection.md) — Fix connection refused, auth failed, and similar errors

## If you're operating the cluster

* Deepen your monitoring insights by setting up [Kubernetes monitoring with PMM](monitor-kubernetes.md)
* Control Pods assignment on specific Kubernetes Nodes by setting up [affinity / anti-affinity](constraints.md)
* Ready to adopt the Operator for production use and need to delete the testing deployment? Use [this guide](delete.md) to do it
* You can also try operating the Operator and database clusters via the web interface with [Percona Everest  :octicons-link-external-16:](https://docs.percona.com/everest/index.html) - an open-source web-based database provisioning tool based on Percona Operators. See [Get started with Percona Everest  :octicons-link-external-16:](https://docs.percona.com/everest/quickstart-guide/quick-install.html) on how to start using it
