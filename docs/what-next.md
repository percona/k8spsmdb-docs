# What's next?

Congratulations! You have completed all the steps in the Get started guide. 

You have the following options to move forward with the Operator:

* Deepen your monitoring insights by setting up [Kubernetes monitoring with PMM](monitor-kubernetes.md)
* Control Pods assignment on specific Kubernetes Nodes by setting up [affinity / anti-affinity](constraints.md)
* Ready to adopt the Operator for production use and need to delete the testing deployment? Use [this guide](delete.md) to do it
* You can also try operating the Operator and database clusters via the web interface with [Percona Everest](https://docs.percona.com/everest/index.html) - an open-source web-based database provisioning tool based on Percona Operators. See [Get started with Percona Everest](https://docs.percona.com/everest/quickstart-guide/quick-install.html) on how to start using it
