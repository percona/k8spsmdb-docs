## Before you start

Clone the repository with all manifests and source code. You'll need it to edit configuration files for the database clusters, Secrets, backups and restores. Run the following command:

```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
$ git clone -b v{{release}} https://github.com/percona/percona-server-mongodb-operator
```

Make sure to clone the correct branch. The branch name is the same as the Operator release version.
