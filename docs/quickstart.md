# Get started

**Start here.** Choose your path based on what you want to do:

* **Building an application?** Follow the **developer path** to get a cluster, connect from your code, and run locally.
* **Deploying or operating the cluster?** Follow the **operator path** to install the Operator, connect with the shell, and run backups and monitoring.

## Developer path

Use this path when you want to connect your application to Percona Server for MongoDB on Kubernetes.

1. **[Get a cluster](get-a-cluster.md)** — Install a cluster quickly or use one your team already provides.
2. **[Connect your application](connect-from-app.md)** — Build the connection URI and use it in your app with any MongoDB driver.
3. **[Get credentials for your app](app-credentials.md)** — Create a dedicated application user and use it in your connection string.
4. **[Connection examples](connection-examples.md)** — Copy minimal examples in Node.js, Python, or Go.
5. **[Connect from your laptop or CI](connect-from-outside.md)** — Use port-forward for local development or expose the cluster for shared access.
6. **[What's next](what-next.md#if-youre-building-an-application)** — App configuration, troubleshooting connection issues, and more.

## Deployment and operations path

Use this path when you deploy and operate the database cluster (install, backup, monitor, upgrade).

1. **[Quick install](kubectl.md)** — Deploy the Operator and database with kubectl or [Helm](helm.md).
2. **[Connect to the database](connect.md)** — Connect with `mongosh` from inside the cluster.
3. **[Insert data](data-insert.md)** — Add sample data to verify the cluster.
4. **[Make a backup](backup-tutorial.md)** — Configure and run a backup.
5. **[Monitor with PMM](monitoring-tutorial.md)** — Set up Percona Monitoring and Management.
6. **[What's next](what-next.md)** — Day two operations, user guides, and more.
