This guide is packed with information, but it can’t cover everything you need to know about the Percona Operator for MongoDB. It also won’t cover every scenario you might come across.

Think of this guide as a solid starting point. There’s always more to learn, and you’ll keep discovering new things as you get hands-on experience. And remember, the more you experiment and work with Percona Operator for MongoDB, the more confident and skilled you’ll become. Don’t be afraid to try things out and ask questions when you get stuck.

Running databases in Kubernetes is not an easy task even with the help of a dedicated Kubernetes Operator. Unlike stateless applications that can be easily scaled and restarted without losing data, databases rely on persistent data storage that must remain consistent across restarts, scaling, and failures. Configuring databases for high availability, performance, and reliability can be complicated, and the dynamic nature of Kubernetes, such as IP address changes and service discovery, brings an additional level of complexity. Also, custom configurations and tuning may be required for optimal performance in specific tasks. While the Operator does a good job in simplifying these challenges, the complexity still remains compared to running databases in traditional setups.
