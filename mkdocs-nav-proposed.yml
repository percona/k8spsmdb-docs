# Proposed navigation for Percona Operator for MongoDB docs
# Replace the `nav:` section in mkdocs-base.yml with the content below.
#
# Summary of changes:
#   - Kubernetes vs Database: sections and subsections labeled so users see at a glance
#     what is Operator/Kubernetes-related vs MongoDB/database-related.
#   - Backup and restore promoted to top-level; labeled as database.
#   - Monitoring: database (PMM) vs Kubernetes explicitly labeled.
#   - Configuration split into "Operator and Kubernetes" vs "Database (MongoDB)".
#   - Upgrade split into "Operator" vs "Database".
#   - Troubleshooting and How-to guides grouped by Kubernetes/Operator vs Database.
#   - VolumeAttributesClass added; Reference legal at end; Release notes collapsed.
#   - Sentence-style capitalization throughout.
